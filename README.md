# Image Captioning System

This project is a web application that generates image captions using a deep learning model trained on the Flickr8k dataset. The application is built using Flask, a popular Python web framework.

## How to use the application

1 - Clone the repository to your local machine.

2 - Navigate to the project directory.

3 - Ensure that you have Python 3.9 installed.

4 - Install the dependencies by running the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

5 - Download the pre-trained model from the following link and place it in the root directory

6 - Start the Flask server by running the following command:
`python app.py`

7 - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

8 - Upload an image to the web application.

9 - Wait for the model to generate the image caption.

10 - View the generated image caption on the web page.

## Model Training

If you would like to train your own model, follow these steps:

1 -  Download the Flickr8k dataset from the following link:
`https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k`

2 - Extract the dataset to a directory on your local machine.

3 - Navigate to the train directory.

4 - Open the `Image_Captioning_System_final.ipynb` Jupyter notebook in Google Colab.

6 - Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model.

7 - Save the trained model to the root directory.
